# SECP-TEKNOLOGY-INFORMATION-SYSTEM

         A Technology Information System (IS) combines hardware, software, data, people, and processes to collect, store, process, 
         and distribute information, enabling organizations to operate efficiently, make decisions, and gain a competitive edge.

My first hands on PC Maintenance . For me, it was a real attempt to bridge the gap between theory and practice.Following along with Dr.’s instructional , I learned how to carefully handle the small screws and delicate cables during disassembly. During the process, I removed the fan, the heat sink, the RAM, and even the hard drive and other IC components.Seeing all these parts laid out in front of me, outside of the case, gave me a much more concrete understanding of what they actually look and feel like in reality.


# PPG industry talk

The PPG talk showed me how IT, data, and ERP systems drive real business value. It’s not just about knowing tools like cloud or AI but knowing how to use them to keep operations efficient. This inspires me to focus not only on skill-building but also on real-world application so can apply them meaningfully.

# ASEAN QUANTUAM TALK

![ASEAN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/limlining/SECP-TEKNOLOGY-INFORMATION-SYSTEM/main/photo_2025-12-17_21-48-32.jpg)
Attending the ASEAN Quantum Summit at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia on 11 December 2025, really gave me a better idea of how quantum technology could affect our daily lives and even help cities like Johor grow into tech hubs. I learned that quantum technology includes quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. Quantum computing uses qubits and superposition to solve complex problems much faster than regular computers. Quantum communication makes information transfer super secure, and quantum sensing can measure things very precisely, which is useful for things like GPS-free navigation and advanced medical imaging.

I was also inspired by how countries in ASEAN, like Singapore, plan their quantum research carefully and link it to real-world applications. It made me realise that even smaller nations can do well in advanced technology if they focus on planning and teamwork. The summit motivated me to keep up with quantum technology and think about how I could contribute to innovation in the future
